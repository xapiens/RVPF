<config title="Shared PAP-CIP configuration definitions">

    <description>
        This file holds basic configuration definitions which are needed
        for proper RVPF-PAP-CIP operations.
    </description>

    <notes>
        It is recommended to leave this file unmodified and to include
        it at the top of the master 'rvpf-config.xml' file, after the
        include of the 'rvpf-config-shared.xml' file.

        It is then possible to override some included definitions: a
        later definition will override an earlier one (except for
        elements containing a 'lang' attribute).
