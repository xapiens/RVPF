<p>The Related Values Processing Framework (RVPF) is being developed to
help the integration of Process Control Data Historian Systems. This is
done by providing support for the conversion, computation and
distribution of data point values between these systems.</p>

<p>The software is written in Java. All libraries needed to use this
software are available under an open source license.</p>

<p>RVPF is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
version 2.1.</p>

<p>The project's home page is located at
