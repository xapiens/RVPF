<!--
 The 'scenario' element represents a single scenario.  Each scenario is
 run in a controlled environments: the Store and Processor services are
 restarted and the points values are purged.

 The 'title' of the scenario is written to the log.  The 'time' is used
 as an initial default time.  This time may be overriden on subsequent
 commands.

 A 'note' is only informative.

 A 'time' attribute in this and other elements may contain a date part
 (YYYY-MM-DD) and / or a time part (HH:MM:SS).  When both are present,
 they are separated by a whitespace.  The second may include a
 fractional part down to the millisecond. When only the date is
 supplied, the time is set to midnight.  When only the time is supplied,
 the date is set to the current default value from the scene, scenario,
 or the system.

 The 'from' attribute contains the location (absolute or relative) of
 the actual scenario definition.

<!--
                Main elements.

<!--
 The 'casting' element contains the assignments of roles in the scenario
 to the actors selected by the 'director'.  This 'director' is a
 property which is set before reading the metadata, where it should
 usually condition which definitions are seen by using the 'if' and
 'unless' attributes.
 -->
<!ELEMENT casting (cast*)>
<!ATTLIST casting
        note CDATA #IMPLIED
        director CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
 A 'scene' groups a number of events within a scenario.  Its 'title' is
 logged and its 'time' may set a new default value.  At the end of a
 scene, any held message is committed.
 -->
<!ELEMENT scene (set | entry | action | exit | repeat | silence | break)*>

<!--
                Child elements.

<!--
 An 'action' describes a value produced by the Processor.  The 'role'
 refers to the Point associated to the value.  The 'time' is the
 timestamp of the value. The 'state' is the state of the value.  The
 'text' is the value.

 The 'line' attribute identifies the event in the log.

 A messaging transaction commit is done on the first 'action' or 'exit'
 after 'entry' elements.

 After being recognized, the value is forwarded to the Processor.
 -->
<!ELEMENT action EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST action
        note CDATA #IMPLIED

<!--
 A 'break' element does nothing.

 This may be used to set a breakpoint for debugging.
 -->
<!ELEMENT break EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST break
        note CDATA #IMPLIED
        line CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
 The 'cast' element attributes a 'role' to an 'actor'.

 If the actor's name is not supplied, it is assumed to be the role's
 name.
 -->
<!ELEMENT cast EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST cast
        note CDATA #IMPLIED
        role CDATA #REQUIRED
        actor CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
 An 'entry' represents a new value sent to the Store.  See 'action' for
 the meaning of the attributes.

 After being recognized, the value is forwarded to the Processor.
 -->
<!ELEMENT entry EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST entry
        note CDATA #IMPLIED
        line CDATA #IMPLIED
        role CDATA #REQUIRED
        time CDATA #REQUIRED
        state CDATA #IMPLIED
        text CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
 An 'exit' represents the same kind of event as the 'action', except
 that the value is NOT forwarded to the Processor.
 -->
<!ELEMENT exit EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST exit
        note CDATA #IMPLIED
        line CDATA #IMPLIED
        role CDATA #REQUIRED
        time CDATA #REQUIRED
        state CDATA #IMPLIED
        text CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
 A 'repeat' asks to repeat an action.

 After being recognized, the value is forwarded to the Processor.
 -->
<!ELEMENT repeat EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST repeat
        note CDATA #IMPLIED
        line CDATA #IMPLIED
        role CDATA #REQUIRED
        time CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
 A 'set' represents the same kind of event as the 'entry', except that
 the value is NOT forwarded to the Processor.
 -->
<!ELEMENT set EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST set
        note CDATA #IMPLIED
        line CDATA #IMPLIED
        role CDATA #REQUIRED
        time CDATA #IMPLIED
        state CDATA #IMPLIED
        text CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
 A 'silence' element will commit the messaging transaction.

 This is useful when some 'action' or 'exit' steps are activated by a
 previous 'action' without an intervening 'entry'.
 -->
<!ELEMENT silence EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST silence
        note CDATA #IMPLIED
        time CDATA #IMPLIED
        line CDATA #IMPLIED>
