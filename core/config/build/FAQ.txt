Q: What is the Clock service?

A:
The Clock service is responsible for the generation of
values at specific times, making sure that there is no holes according
the the schedule (usually specified by a 'Crontab' parameter). These
values are often used as time triggers for computations.

The most significant part of a clock event is, of course, its time
stamp. Because some historian do not have a high resolution for time, the
fractional part of the time is used as value. Since the schedule does
not include time with a fractional part (fraction of second), that
value is always 0 for a Clock event.

S: Directories

Q: What is the "traces" directory?

A:
The "traces" directory holds informations that
can be seen as an 'audit log'. While the log files are meant for monitoring and
debugging, trace files are meant for verifications. Major component
services, like Processors, Stores, even Clocks, maintain traces files.
Each of these components gets a directory named whith a base 36
version of the component UUID (this is done because some OS have
configurations where the length of a file name is limited to 31
characters). You can confirm this by looking into the contained UUID
file. You will also find in that directory a file with the generic
entiry name (like 'Store') which contains the specific configured JMX
object name. Most importantly, you will find, in these directories,
subdirectories naming input and output events of the associated
service; for a Store, you should see at least an 'updated'
subdirectory. These subdirectories contain the trace files themselves,
named after the day of the occurence of the events (the time of the
event, not the timestamp of the value).

Each trace file contains one line for each event with the following fields:

 1 - the time of the event
 2 - the name or UUID of the point
 3 - the timestamp/version of the value
 4 - the state of the value within '[ ]' (only when present)
 5 - a value within quotes
